<div class="section" id="what-are-streams">
<h2>What are streams?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-streams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Graylog2 streams are a mechanism to route messages into categories in realtime while they are processed. You define rules that
instruct Graylog2 which message to route where. Imagine sending these three messages to Graylog2:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>message: INSERT failed (out of disk space)
level: 3 (error)
source: database-host-1

message: Added user &#39;foo&#39;.
level: 6 (informational)
source: database-host-2

message: smtp ERR: remote closed the connection
level: 3 (error)
source: application-x
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>One of the many things that you could do with streams is creating a stream called <em>Database errors</em> that is catching every error
message from one of your database hosts.</p>
<p>Create a new stream with these rules: (stream rules are AND connected)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Field <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">level</span></code> must be greater than <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">4</span></code></li>
<li>Field <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">source</span></code> must match regular expression <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^database-host-\d+</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will route every new message with a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">level</span></code> higher than <em>WARN</em> and a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">source</span></code> that matches the database host regular
expression into the stream.</p>
<p>A message will be routed into every stream that has all its rules matching. This means that a message can be part of many streams
and not just one.</p>
<p>The stream is now appearing in the streams list and a click on its title will show you all database errors.</p>
<p>The next parts of this document cover how to be alerted in case of too many errors, some specific error types that should never
happen or how to forward the errors to another system or endpoint.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-s-the-difference-to-saved-searches">
<h3>What&#8217;s the difference to saved searches?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-the-difference-to-saved-searches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The biggest difference is that streams are processed in realtime. This allows realtime alerting and forwarding to other systems.
Imagine forwarding your database errors to another system or writing them to a file by regularly reading them from the message
storage. Realtime streams do this much better.</p>
<p>Another difference is that searches for complex stream rule sets are always comparably cheap to perform because a message is
<em>tagged</em> with stream IDs when processed. A search for Graylog2 internally always looks like this, no matter how many stream
rules you have configured:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>streams:[STREAM_ID]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Building a query with all rules would cause significantly higher load on the message storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-create-a-stream">
<h3>How do I create a stream?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-create-a-stream" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Navigate to the streams section from the top navigation bar</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Create stream&#8221;</li>
<li>Save the stream after entering a name and a description. For example <em>All error messages</em> and
<em>Catching all error messages from all sources</em></li>
<li>The stream is now saved but <strong>not yet activated</strong>. Add stream rules in the next dialogue. Try it against some messages by
entering a message ID on the same page. Save the rules when the right messages are matched or not matched.</li>
<li>The stream is marked as <em>paused</em> in the list of streams. Activate the stream by hitting <em>Resume this stream</em> in the <em>Action</em>
dropdown.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alerts">
<h2>Alerts<a class="headerlink" href="#alerts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can define conditions that trigger alerts. For example whenever the stream <em>All production exceptions</em> has more than 50
messages per minute or when the field <em>milliseconds</em> had a too high standard deviation in the last five minutes.</p>
<p>Hit <em>Manage alerts</em> in the stream <em>Action</em> dropdown to see already configured alerts, alerts that were fired in the past or
to configure new alert conditions.</p>
<p>Graylog2 ships with default <em>alert callbacks</em> and can be extended with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.graylog.org/resources/documentation/general/plugins">plugins</a></p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-difference-between-alert-callbacks-and-alert-receivers">
<h3>What is the difference between alert callbacks and alert receivers?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-alert-callbacks-and-alert-receivers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two type of actions to be triggered when an alert is fired: Alert callbacks or an email to a list of alert
receivers.</p>
<p>Alert callbacks are single actions that are just called once. For example: The <em>Email Alert Callback</em> is triggering
an email to exactly one receiver and the <em>HTTP Alert Callback</em> is calling a HTTP endpoint once.</p>
<p>The alert receivers in difference will all receive an email about the same alert.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="outputs">
<h2>Outputs<a class="headerlink" href="#outputs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The stream output system allows you to forward every message that is routed into a stream to other destinations.</p>
<p>Outputs are managed globally (like message inputs) and not for single streams. You can create new outputs and activate them
for as many streams as you like. This way you can configure a forwarding destination once and select multiple streams to use it.</p>
<p>Graylog2 ships with default outputs and can be extended with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.graylog.org/resources/documentation/general/plugins">plugins</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-cases">
<h2>Use cases<a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These are a few example use cases for streams:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Forward a subset of messages to other data analysis or BI systems to reduce their license costs.</li>
<li>Monitor exception or error rates in your whole environment and broken down per subsystem.</li>
<li>Get a list of all failed SSH logins and use the <em>quickvalues</em> to analyze which usernames where affected.</li>
<li>Catch all HTTP POST requests to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/login</span></code> that were answered with a HTTP 302 and route them into a stream called
<em>Successful user logins</em>. Now get a chart of when users logged in and use the <em>quickvalues</em> to get a list of users that performed
the most logins in the search time frame.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-are-streams-processed-internally">
<h2>How are streams processed internally?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-are-streams-processed-internally" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most important thing to know about Graylog2 stream matching is that there is no duplication of messages. Every message that comes
in is matched against all rules of a stream. The internal ID of every stream that has <em>all</em> rules matching is appended to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">streams</span></code>
array of the processed message.</p>
<p>All analysis methods and searches that are bound to streams can now easily narrow their operation by searching with a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">streams:[STREAM_ID]</span></code> limit. This is done automatically by Graylog and does not have to be provided by the user.</p>
<img alt="../_images/internal_stream_processing.png" src="../_images/internal_stream_processing.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="stream-processing-runtime-limits">
<h2>Stream Processing Runtime Limits<a class="headerlink" href="#stream-processing-runtime-limits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An important step during the processing of a message is the stream classification. Every message is matched against the user-configured
stream rules. If every rule of a stream matches, the message is added to this stream. Applying stream rules is done during the indexing
of a message only, so the amount of time spent for the classification of a message is crucial for the overall performance and message
throughput the system can handle.</p>
<p>There are certain scenarios when a stream rule takes very long to match. When this happens for a number of messages, message processing
can stall, messages waiting for processing accumulate in memory and the whole system could become non-responsive. Messages are lost
manual intervention is necessary. This is the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>To prevent this, the runtime of stream rule matching is limited. When it is taking longer than the configured runtime limit, the process
of matching this exact message against the rules of this specific stream is aborted. Message processing in general and for this specific
message continues though. As the runtime limit needs to be configured pretty high (usually a magnitude higher as a regular stream rule
match takes), any excess of it is considered a fault and is recorded for this stream. If the number of recorded faults for a single stream
is higher than a configured threshold, the stream rule set of this stream is considered faulty and the stream is disabled. This is done
to protect the overall stability and performance of message processing. Obviously, this is a tradeoff and based on the assumption, that
the total loss of one or more messages is worse than a loss of stream classification for these.</p>
<p>There are scenarios where this might not be applicable or even detrimental. If there is a high fluctuation of the message load including
situations where the message load is much higher than the system can handle, overall stream matching can take longer than then configured
timeout. If this happens repeatedly, all streams get disabled. This is a clear indicator that your system is over-utilized and not able
to handle the peak message load.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-configure-the-timeout-values-if-the-defaults-do-not-match">
<h3>How to configure the timeout values if the defaults do not match<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-configure-the-timeout-values-if-the-defaults-do-not-match" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two configuration variables in the configuration file of the server, which influence the behavior of this functionality.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stream_processing_timeout</span></code> defines the maximum amount of time the rules of a stream are able to spend. When this is exceeded, stream
rule matching for this stream is aborted and a fault is recorded. This setting is defined in milliseconds, the default is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2000</span></code> (2 seconds).</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stream_processing_max_faults</span></code> is the maximum number of times a single stream can exceed this runtime limit. When it happens more often,
the stream is disabled until it is manually reenabled. The default for this setting is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-could-cause-it">
<h3>What could cause it?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-could-cause-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If a single stream has been disabled and all others are doing well, the chances are high that one or more stream rules are performing bad under
certain circumstances. In most cases, this is related to stream rules which are utilizing regular expressions. For most other stream rules types
the general runtime is constant, while it varies very much for regular expressions, influenced by the regular expression itself and the input
matched against it. In some special cases, the difference between a match and a non-match of a regular expression can be in the order of 100
or even 1000. This is caused by a phenomenon called <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>. There are good write-ups about it on the web which will help
you understanding it.</p>

<h2>Programmatic access via the REST API<a class="headerlink" href="#programmatic-access-via-the-rest-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many organisations already run monitoring infrastructure that are able to alert operations staff when incidents are detected.
These systems are often capable of either polling for information on a regular schedule or being pushed new alerts - this article describes how to
use the Graylog2 Stream Alert API to poll for currently active alerts in order to further process them in third party products.</p>
<div class="section" id="checking-for-currently-active-alert-triggered-conditions">
<h3>Checking for currently active alert/triggered conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-for-currently-active-alert-triggered-conditions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Graylog2 stream alerts can currently be configured to send emails when one or more oft the associated alert conditions evaluate to true. While
sending email solves many immediate problems when it comes to alerting, it can be helpful to gain programmatic access to the currently active alerts.</p>
<p>Each stream which has alerts configured also has a list of active alerts, which can potentially be empty if there were no alerts so far.
Using the stream&#8217;s ID, one can check the current state of the alert conditions associated with the stream using the authenticated API call:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>GET /streams/&lt;streamid&gt;/alerts/check
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It returns a description of the configured conditions as well as a count of how many triggered the alert. This data can be used to for example
send SNMP traps in other parts of the monitoring system.</p>
<p>Sample JSON return value:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>

<h3>Using regular expressions for stream matching<a class="headerlink" href="#using-regular-expressions-for-stream-matching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Stream rules support matching field values using regular expressions.
Graylog2 uses the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java Pattern class</a> to execute regular expressions.</p>
<p>For the individual elements of regular expression syntax, please refer to Oracle&#8217;s documentation, however the syntax largely follows the familiar
regular expression languages in widespread use today and will be familiar to most.</p>
<p>However, one key question that is often raised is matching a string in case insensitive manner. Java regular expressions are case sensitive by
default. Certain flags, such as the one to ignore case sensitivity can either be set in the code, or as an inline flag in the regular expression.</p>
<p>To for example route every message that matches the browser name in the following user agent string:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.107 Safari/537.36
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the regular expression <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.*applewebkit.*</span></code> will not match because it is case sensitive.
In order to match the expression using any combination of upper- and lowercase characters use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(?i)</span></code> flag as such:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>(?i).*applewebkit.*
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Most of the other flags supported by Java are rarely used in the context of matching stream rules or extractors, but if you need them their use
is documented on the same Javadoc page by Oracle.</p>

<p>No. Currently there is no way to re-process or re-match messages into streams.</p>
<p>Only new messages are routed into the current set of streams.</p>
